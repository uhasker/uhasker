## Who am I?

I'm Mikhail Berkov ([@uhasker](https://github.com/uhasker)), a German software engineer, mathematician and writer.
I'm also the co-founder and CTO of [Titanom](https://github.com/titanom).

## Books

You're most likely here for one of my books.

[The Python Minibook](https://github.com/uhasker/the-python-minibook) is aimed at people looking to get into programming.
It's a self-contained introduction to one of the most popular programming languages (Python).
At the end you'll develop your own project, a little computer game. ðŸŽ‰

[Getting Things Done in Next.js](https://uhasker.github.io/getting-things-done-in-next-js/) is a complete introduction to one of the most mainstream web development stacks.
It teaches you JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and concepts that you need to successfully create your own web application from start to finish.
At the end you'll develop your own project, a little task management application. ðŸŽ‰

[Large Language Models](https://uhasker.github.io/large-language-models/) is an introduction toâ€”wellâ€”Large Language Models.
It's quite technical, but also quite accessible even if you're not really good at mathematics.

[Introduction to Linux](https://nachthammer.github.io/introduction-to-linux) is an introduction to Linux for complete beginners.
We wrote this book together with the awesome [@nachthammer](https://github.com/nachthammer).

## Medium

I have a Medium with multiple technical publications:

- [Thinking Sand](https://medium.com/thinking-sand) which contains AI, news, explainers, opinions and links
- [More Python](https://medium.com/more-python) which contains a lot of Python guides both for beginners and advanced software engineers
- [No-Nonsense Information Security](https://medium.com/no-nonsense-information-security) which contains no-nonsense to information security

## Substack

I have a [Substack](https://mikhailberkov.substack.com/) where I give advice to young knowledge workers.
Sometimes I also make jokes there, some of which might be _moderately_ funny.
