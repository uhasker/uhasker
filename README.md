## Books

You're most likely here for one of my books.

[The Python Minibook](https://github.com/uhasker/the-python-minibook) is aimed at people looking to get into programming.
It's a self-contained introduction to the one of the most popular programming languages (Python).
At the end you'll develop your own project, a little computer game. ðŸŽ‰

[Getting Things Done in Next.js](https://uhasker.github.io/getting-things-done-in-next-js/) is a complete introduction to one of the most mainstream web development stacks.
It teaches you JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and concepts that you need to successfully create your own web application from start to finish.
At the end you'll develop your own project, a little task management application. ðŸŽ‰

[Large Language Models](https://uhasker.github.io/large-language-models/) is an introduction toâ€”wellâ€”Large Language Models.
It's quite technical, but also quite accessible even if you're not really good at mathematics.

[Introduction to Linux](https://nachthammer.github.io/introduction-to-linux) is an introduction to Linux for complete beginners.
We wrote this book together with the awesome [@nachthammer](https://github.com/nachthammer).

## Substack

I have a [Substack](https://mikhailberkov.substack.com/) where I give advice to young knowledge workers.
Sometimes I also make jokes there, some of which might be _moderately_ funny.

I also have another [Substack](https://thinkingsand.substack.com/) with articles about AI for a non-technical audience.
